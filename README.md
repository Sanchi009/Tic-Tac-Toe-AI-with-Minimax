# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Minimax

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of an AI player for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is used to create an AI opponent that plays optimally and tries to win or draw the game.

## Features

- Implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game logic.
- AI player using the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Command-line interface for playing against the AI.

## How It Works

The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games. It explores all possible moves and outcomes to find the best move for the player and the worst move for the opponent.

In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe:
1. The AI explores all possible moves from the current game state.
2. It assigns a score to each move based on the outcome of the game (win, lose, draw).
3. The AI chooses the move with the highest score if it's the AI's turn, or the move with the lowest score if it's the opponent's turn.
